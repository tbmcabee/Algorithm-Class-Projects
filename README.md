# U421 Assignments

These were assignments from my U421 Design and Analysis of Algorithms course, which includes an implementation of
DFS and BFS algorithms (Assignment 3) and an external sort program that utilizes merge sort (Assignment 4). 

# Assignment 3 was based on the following parameters: 

Use Java to implement DFS and BFS graph traversal algorithms. Read the input graph from a .txt file. 
An adjacency matrix is used to store a directed graph. Your program should ask the user to input the file name first. 
Then output the DFS and BFS traversal results.

File format example for a directed graph with 5 vertices (the first integer is the number of vertices, then the matrix):

5

0 1 1 0 1

0 0 1 0 1

0 0 0 1 0

0 0 0 0 1

0 0 0 0 0

# Assignment 4 was based on the following parameters: 

Use Java to implement an external sort program. The input data are stored in a file with name input.txt 
(elements in the files are all integers, and totally there are 1 million integers in the file). 
I attached the input file.  Assume your computer’s memory space is not big enough to load the whole file and 
only ¼ of the file can fit in the main memory. Write the final sorting result to file result.txt.
